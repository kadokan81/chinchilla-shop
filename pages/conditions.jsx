				<h2>What's in a cat contract?</h2>
				<p>
					The basic agreement is to provide a live, healthy kitten for
					consideration. The understanding is that the cat is not for breeding
					purposes, but for pet purposes only, into perpetuity. A non-refundable
					deposit will be held for kittens once applicants are accepted, which
					is placed per conditions of a contract, and applied to the final
					remuneration. No refunds are given, no exceptions. All kittens must be
					spayed or neutered. We are providing a sample contract for your
					consideration and acceptance online.
